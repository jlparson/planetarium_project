                            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. 
                            In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter,
                             the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet.
                              It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
                               Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
